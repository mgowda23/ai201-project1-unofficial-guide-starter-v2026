# ─── Chunking (Milestone 3) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `chunker.py::split_documents` cuts at `##` headings, so the section decides
# how long a chunk is and these two no longer do the work they used to.

# A ceiling now, not a target. The longest `##` section in city_guides is 711
# characters, so nothing here reaches it; it only matters if a section ever
# arrives longer, and then it is split on blank lines rather than mid-sentence.

# Zero on purpose. Overlap repairs a thought that a fixed-size window cut in
# half, and cutting at the author's own headings never cuts one in half. The

# LOWER IS BETTER: 0.3 is a close match, 0.9 is unrelated.
#
# Measured in Milestone 4. My five in-corpus questions land at 0.194 to 0.384
# and my five out-of-corpus ones at 0.409 to 0.975, so the gap is
# 0.38390 -> 0.40877 and only 0.0249 wide. 0.40 sits in it, just above the
# midpoint of 0.3963 on purpose: the near side is a question I could answer
# and wrongly refuse, which is the error a user actually notices, so I gave
# that side the larger margin (0.016 below vs 0.0088 above).
#
# 0.6, the starter default, let three of my five out-of-corpus questions
# through — they are travel questions about real places my corpus doesn't
# cover, and they score much closer than the far-field ones do.

# Setting it to any other name — unit 2's "try a second embedding model"
# stretch option — switches to loading that model from Hugging Face instead,
# which needs `pip install 'sentence-transformers>=3.4,<3.5'` first. store.py
